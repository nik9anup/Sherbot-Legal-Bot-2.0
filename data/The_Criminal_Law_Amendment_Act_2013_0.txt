      The Criminal Law (Amendment) Bill, 2012 was introduced in the Lok Sabha on 4th
December, 2012 in order to provide for stringent punishment for crimes against women, as
also to provide for more victim friendly procedures in the trials of such cases. After the
horrendous incident of gang rape, which occurred on 16th December, 2012 in Delhi, a
Committee, headed by Justice J. S. Verma was set up to make recommendations on amending
the various laws to provide for speedy justice and enhanced punishment for offenders in
cases of sexual assault of extreme nature. The Justice Verme Committee submitted its Report
on 23rd January, 2013.

      2. It was felt necessary to bring the revised laws into effect as soon as possible, as any
crime against women committed during the period when the law is in making will be punishable
only under the existing laws. In view of the urgency of the matter, the Criminal Law
(Amendment) Ordinance, 2013 was promulgated on 3rd February, 2013.
      3. The Department-related Parliamentary Standing Committee on Home Affairs examined
the Criminal Law (Amendment) Bill, 2012 and tabled its Report in Parliament on 1st March,
2013. Keeping in view the recommendations of the Department-related Parliamentary Standing
Committee on Home Affairs, the recommendations of Justice Verma Committee and the views
and comments received from various quarters including women groups, the Government
have drafted the Criminal Law (Amendment) Bill, 2013.
      4. The Criminal Law (Amendment) Bill, 2103 seeks to amend the Indian Penal Code,
1860, the Criminal Procedure Code, 1973, the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 and the Protection of
Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012. These amendments seek to:—
            (a) make specific provisions for punishment for the offences of causing grievous
      hurt by acid attack and also for an attempt thereof;
            (b) define and prescribe punishment for the offences of stalking, voyeurism and
      sexual harassment;
           (c) widen the definition of rape; broaden the ambit of aggravated rape; and
      enhance the punishment thereof;
            (d) prescribe for punishment extending to the sentence of death, for an offence
      where in the course of commission of an offence of rape, the offender inflicts any
      injury which causes the death of the victim or causes the victim to be in a persistent
      vegetative state;
           (e) punish the repeat offenders of rape with imprisonment for life (which shall
      mean the remainder of the person’s natural life), or with death;
            (f) prescribe that those convicted for the offence of gang rape shall be punished
      with rigorous imprisonment for a minimum of twenty years extendable to life (which
      shall mean the remainder of that person’s natural life) and fine; to be paid to the victim
      to meet the medical expenses;
            (g) enhance punishment under sections 354 and 509 of Indian Penal Code;
             (h) amend sections 54-A, 154, 160, 161, 164, 198-B, 273, 309 and 327 of the Code
      of Criminal Procedure, 1973 for providing for women friendly procedures; greater
      sensitivity to the requirement of physically and mentally disabled persons, under-
      aged children and old persons in the course of investigation and trial; for speedy trial
      of rape cases, and better recording of evidence;

                                              17
                                             18
           (i) provide that all hospitals shall immediately provide first aid and/or medical
     treatment, free of cost, to the victims of acid attack or rape; and provide for punishment
     for contravention thereof;
         (j) provide that the compensation payable by the State shall be in addition to the
     payment of fine to the victim;
          (k) amend the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 by way of inserting sections 53A,
     114A, substitution of section 119 and amendment of section 146 to protect the dignity
     of women;
          (l) amend the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 so as to
     harmonise the said Act with the provisions of the Bill.
     5. The Bill seeks to achieve the above objectives.
