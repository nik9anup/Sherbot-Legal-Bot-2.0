Peak Mind
Taking care of an ailing family member, dealing with someone's demise or just being
homebound and witnessing the current state of affairs can impact your mental health.
But Peak Mind believes that making your emotions work for you rather than against
you is key to successfully passing through the choppy waters. Schedule your first
session with Peak Mind to talk to a mentor trained in your counselling topic. Each
session is usually priced at Rs 1,999, but the service has been heavily subsidised right
now given the need.

Therapize India
Therapize India asked therapy speakers about the barriers to accessing mental
healthcare today, and 40 per cent of them claimed that "affordability and a lack of
transparency around therapy fees is a big hurdle". And so, the organisation has
launched low-cost COVID Support Circles for people dealing with grief, burnout and
anxiety. You get access to four sessions for Rs 250, starting next month.
